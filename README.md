# llistVis
This project was a proof of concept of the UI capabilities on how to visualize data structures. I wrote this in c++ using the SFML graphics library.

This design lets the user select options for functions you would typically see a linked list have.
Once an option is selected, the user is prompted on the console window what information they would like their node to contain.
After giving the node its contents, a new option is displayed allowing the user to "step through" the function showing each step a linked list would take in order to complete the function while visually showing the affected connections change.

Initial design - Dr. Rika Yoshii's version of the linked list:
